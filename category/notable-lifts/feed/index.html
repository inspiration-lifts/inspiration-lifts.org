<p style="text-align: center">When Sri Chinmoy lifted his Smart Car at York College on November 13th, 2004 it was the culmination of the entire programme that evening.  Sri Chinmoy ascended to the top of the platform, eight feet above the stage. The car had been driven onto a ground platform that was attached by four steel tension rods to the lifting apparatus. Sri Chinmoy positioned himself underneath the shoulder pads, meditated briefly and then, with a mighty heave, brought his body into an upright position. The car swung back and forth freely for several seconds. Seated in the front row of the audience, Frank Zane later said: “Guru lifted the car nearly an inch and a half off the floor. I could see it dangling!” Needless to say, this lift brought the house down.</p>
<p>The 2004 Smart Car lift shares pieces of equipment with one of Sri Chinmoy’s oldest and most signature lifts: the standing calf raise with ground ramp. The ramp could accommodate large objects, animals, and groups of people &#8211; cars, planes, grand pianos, pumpkins, elephants, and trees, as well as myriads of people from all nations.</p>
<p>“God’s choice warriors<br />
Shake hands with impossibility<br />
With a roaring laughter.”<br />
– Sri Chinmoy</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>May-August 1986</strong></p>
<p>This particular mark stands out as a milestone in Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s<br />
early weightlifting career in a different sense. In so many ways Sri<br />
Chinmoy&#8217;s lifts were also powerful lessons about life to those who saw<br />
and heard about them, and in this case Sri Chinmoy showed that inner<br />
progress could indeed be made in the face of failure as well as<br />
success.  Sri Chinmoy began his attempt on this weight on 8 May with<br />
this soulful prayer:</p>
<blockquote><p>My Beloved Supreme,<br />
You are my inspiration,<br />
You are my<br />
aspiration,<br />
You are my realisation.<br />
If ever I can lift up 300 pounds,</p>
<p>It will be 100 per cent<br />
Your unconditional Compassion,<br />
Unconditional<br />
Blessings,<br />
Unconditional Fulfilment.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, on that day, the dumbbell did not move. And it was not to<br />
move for a further four months, and a colossal 212 attempts. And yet<br />
throughout these four months, Sri Chinmoy remained the epitome of<br />
determination and never-give-up-spirit. Here, for example is his prayer<br />
on July 14:</p>
<blockquote><p>My sweet Lord Supreme,<br />
I do know there is a life<br />
That is<br />
known as the life of failure<br />
But I also know, I also feel,<br />
That by Your<br />
Grace infinite<br />
Someday, somehow,<br />
I shall overcome it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, on 11 August the bar gave way &#8211; a weight of 303 1/4 pounds. <em>&#8220;Say I have set my goal at 300 pounds, and I cannot do it.&#8221;</em>, Sri Chinmoy would later remark. <em>&#8220;The<br />
very fact that I have been devotedly practising and practising gives me<br />
joy, and the tenacity or perseverance that I am showing is itself<br />
progress. Anything that we do devotedly and soulfully helps us make<br />
progress.&#8221;</em></p>
