<p>The standard standing calf raise was the second major lift that Sri Chinmoy introduced into his weightlifting repertoire. On June 1st, 1986 he did repetitions with 400 pounds using a modified Dan Lurie model. At each practice session, Sri Chinmoy would work up to his peak weight and then have the selector fork adjusted down so that another 100 pounds were added to the total. By the end of June, he was comfortably doing repetitions with 1,300 pounds; at the end of September he was at 1,700 pounds; on November 30th Sri Chinmoy lifted and supported 2,000 pounds using his calves.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy performed this lift many times in public and 5-time Mr. Universe Mahasamrat Bill Pearl recently said: “The most remarkable lift that I am impressed with and I say to this day, believe it or not, was the standing calf raise. I saw the man do standing calf raises with 1800 pounds. For a man his size and his age that in itself is phenomenal. It is something people cannot even comprehend.”<br />
At York College on November 13th, 2004 – at the age of 73 – he set a new personal record of 2,400 pounds in the standing calf raise.</p>
<p>“Self-transcendence is the song of constant inner and outer progress.”<br />
– Sri Chinmoy</p>

<p>Throughout his weightlifting career, Sri Chinmoy had always tried to improve the strength of his wrists and forearms by doing wrist curls and wrist flexes. He liked to do these at home, seated in a chair with the dumbbell resting on his knee. It was a staple of his regular morning workout, and he would work his right and left wrists equally. Many experts had commented over the years that Sri Chinmoy’s wrists and forearms must have been extraordinarily strong to handle so much weight day after day. In 2005, Sri Chinmoy became inspired to push his wrists to the limit. During his birthday celebration that year, he did a seated dumbbell wrist curl of 100 pounds 10 times with each hand. Just five months later, on January 30th, 2006 while visiting Malaysia, he set his personal record when he curled 270 pounds 30 times with each wrist. The dumbbell was so massive that two men had to use a specially constructed rolling lift to move and lower it onto Sri Chinmoy’s knees. He dedicated the lift to all the men and women of his age – 74 years young!</p>
<p>“I wish to show that age is no barrier. The word<br />
impossible is only in the mind and not in the heart.”<br />
–Sri Chinmoy</p>
